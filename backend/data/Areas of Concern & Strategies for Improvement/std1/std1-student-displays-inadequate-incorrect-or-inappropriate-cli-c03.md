# STANDARD 1: Professional Responsibility and Accountability

## Concern
Student displays inadequate, incorrect, or inappropriate clinical reasoning/judgment (THIS PROBLEM CAN ALSO BE APPLICABLE TO STANDARD 2)

## Strategies & Guidance
- Review clinical reasoning case studies, continue discussing your patients with your instructor and RN to gain understanding of clinical reasoning/judgment, debrief/reflect on your clinical day with a peer and share in post conference. Discuss what you are "noticing" with the RN, instructor, and peers, sometimes talking out loud helps you make links and connections to enhance your clinical reasoning.
- Continue using Concept Maps & Clinical Judgment Models: Think about how the patient's medications, fluids, focused assessments, complications/S&S, therapies /treatments relate to medical diagnoses, related tests/Labs (Hi, Lo, WNL), applicable nursing diagnoses, patient teaching/nursing interventions. In other words, how does what we do relate to what is going on with the patient - if something does not make sense then it needs to be questioned.
