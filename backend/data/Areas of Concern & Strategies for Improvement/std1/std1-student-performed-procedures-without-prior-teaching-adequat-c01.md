# STANDARD 1: Professional Responsibility and Accountability

## Concern
Student performed procedures without prior teaching, adequate supervision, or in violation of program/agency policy

## Strategies & Guidance
Immediately halt unsupervised patient care until student has demonstrated safe practice consistently while supervised. Review BCCNM Regulatory Supervision of Students.
- Have student fill out hospital authority incident report if required and BSN Safety Event form
- Refer to BCIT BSN Program Student Guidelines and Procedures
Strategies:
- Suggest student review the British Columbia College of Nurses & Midwives (BCCNM) Professional Standards
- Suggest student review the BCCNM Professional Responsibility & Accountability Module
- 1:1 meeting with student and instructor outside of the clinical area to discuss the situation - Program Head may be present
