# STANDARD 1: Professional Responsibility and Accountability

## Concern
Student displays a lack of initiative and/or confidence in nursing practice

## Strategies & Guidance
Strategies:
- Find ways to boost your internal motivation (e.g. reflect on why you chose to pursue nursing, imagine yourself as a nurse). Continue to seek support from friends and family. Reflect on your success in clinical and the things you do well. When in clinical, move, walk, and talk with "energy" even when you do not feel (this is a behavioral trick that can help boost confidence and morale). Remember you are in the learning process, if you make a mistake, give yourself permission to learn from this and grow in your practice.
- Create a specific learning plan for you - think about what you want to work on. Make your goals specific use SMART Goals Journal/Self-reflect after each shift to consider your progress.
- When feeling yourself losing confidence "Stop" "Breath" and "Organize". When able, advocate for some time to gather your thoughts (be specific: e.g. "can I have 5 minutes to think, then I will come find you and report").
