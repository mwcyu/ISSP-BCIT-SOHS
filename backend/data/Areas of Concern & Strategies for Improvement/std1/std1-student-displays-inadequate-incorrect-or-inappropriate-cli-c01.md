# STANDARD 1: Professional Responsibility and Accountability

## Concern
Student displays inadequate, incorrect, or inappropriate clinical reasoning/judgment (THIS PROBLEM CAN ALSO BE APPLICABLE TO STANDARD 2)

## Strategies & Guidance
Strategies:
- Clinical Reasoning: Utilize PRE (problem, related to, evidence) - knowing what the problem is and what it is related to will guide you to specific interventions. Knowing the evidence will guide you to what to evaluate.
- Separate your problems and narrow them down/be specific. E.g. impaired perfusion could be: risk for hemorrhage, risk for VTE, fluid overload, hypovolemia, etc. - there needs to be a specific problem to determine specific interventions.
- Remember instructor/MRN do not know your thoughts - share all the connections, not just parts of the connections
- Think about the missing information/conflicting information - do you gather more data/ do you need more than one source? "More than one source, more likely the course".
- Make sure you are not making assumptions - ensure you have supporting evidence.
