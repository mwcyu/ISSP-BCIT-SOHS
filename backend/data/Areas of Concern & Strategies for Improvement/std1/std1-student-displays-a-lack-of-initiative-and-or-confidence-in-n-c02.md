# STANDARD 1: Professional Responsibility and Accountability

## Concern
Student displays a lack of initiative and/or confidence in nursing practice

## Strategies & Guidance
- Continue to build your knowledge and safety as this will increase your confidence. Don't pause or hesitate when a patient asks you something you do not know - provide reassurance and state you will find out - it is okay if you don't have an answer for all the questions a patient asks - listen, validate their concern/questions, and then find shared goals for you to complete your tasks.
- Ensure you are coming to clinical prepared and on time/early to minimize anxiety and increase your confidence.
