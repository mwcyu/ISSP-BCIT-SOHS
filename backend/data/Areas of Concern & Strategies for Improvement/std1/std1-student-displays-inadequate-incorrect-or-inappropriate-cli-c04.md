# STANDARD 1: Professional Responsibility and Accountability

## Concern
Student displays inadequate, incorrect, or inappropriate clinical reasoning/judgment (THIS PROBLEM CAN ALSO BE APPLICABLE TO STANDARD 2)

## Strategies & Guidance
- Ensure you have a plan of care that is specific for all your patients - Actual and Potential Problems with appropriate assessments and interventions. Look at the plan of care already created for your patients on the unit as a guide. In addition, it will help you "investigate" what is going on with the patient. Don't just fixate on current patient problems, also anticipate what could happen and how you would intervene. Your problems should not be broad concepts e.g. gas exchange, perfusion - they need to be specific to the current state of patient e.g. respiratory depression for post-op. Problems that are specific to your patient with detailed assessment and interventions will provide you a plan of care for your patients.
