# STANDARD 1: Professional Responsibility and Accountability

## Concern
Student displays inadequate, incorrect, or inappropriate clinical reasoning/judgment (THIS PROBLEM CAN ALSO BE APPLICABLE TO STANDARD 2)

## Strategies & Guidance
- Ask yourself 'why' regarding each aspect of your patient's care, run through scenarios and think about what you would do - ask a peer what they would do - if something does not make sense, stop and think about the situation, different options, weigh options according to the patient's best interest and try to identify a solution (ask for assistance when required/outside of scope).
- When you "notice" something abnormal make sure you write it down on your cheat sheet. Then once you leave the room, take the time to use your Clinical Judgment Model to help determine how you would "interpret" and "respond".
- At the end of every assessment pause and consider, "what does this information tell me"? Consider how the data validates/invalidates a patient problem. Make the adjustment, then make sense of it. Consider the links to pathophysiology, lab, diagnostics, medications, etc. Consider what is "actually" going on for the patient. If something does not make sense, seek clarity.
