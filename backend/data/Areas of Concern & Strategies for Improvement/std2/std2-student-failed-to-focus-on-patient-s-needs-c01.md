# STANDARD 2: Knowledge-Based Practice

## Concern
Student failed to focus on patient's needs

## Strategies & Guidance
Strategies:
- Utilize concept maps & CJMs to focus on specific patient needs.
- Become familiar with the most common physical or mental illnesses or surgeries/procedures on your unit and familiarize yourself with policies and PPO and then focus on your actual patient. Avoid using care plan books and fixating on A/P definitions of co-morbidities - determine what is going on with the patient and why they have that co-morbidity how you would assess and treat your patient.
- Prior to caring for your patient, think of what patient education you may need to know and have the goals for your patient on the cheat sheet and understand reasoning/education behind these goals. Write out your Actual and Potential Problems for patients on your cheat sheet with assessments and interventions this will help guide your care.
- Look at everything (anatomy/pathophysiology) in a system and relate the co-morbidity to the system, instead of trying to see the links just between the co-morbidities.
