# STANDARD 2: Knowledge-Based Practice

## Concern
Student failed to focus on patient's needs

## Strategies & Guidance
- Avoid overthinking, getting stuck at the cellular level, or creating links that are a far "stretch" - understand what you need to know to care for the patient - assessment, interventions, etc. Be concise and clear.
- When you are going into a patient's room have your priority problems in mind so they can guide your assessments - Look at your cheat sheet and verbally review problems. Ensure you have a well-used cheat sheet. Ensure there is an area for Actual and Potential Problems, notes, and questions. Write down what questions you have about your patients during your shift - this will prompt you to find the answers. E.g. why does the patient still have a foley when he is post op day 2?
- Avoid having too many pieces of paper and try to keep your concept map to one page with identified priority problems - expand these on the back with assessments/interventions etc., research.
