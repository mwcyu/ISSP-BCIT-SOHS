# STANDARD 2: Knowledge-Based Practice

## Concern
Struggling to prioritize/prioritizing inappropriately

## Strategies & Guidance
- Build on your systematic assessments to identify a focused assessment for your patient. Ideally perform the focused assessment "first" to validate a priority concern. Follow your gut when you notice abnormal data. Pause and think "is there more information that I need right now, have my priorities changed". Use your cheat sheet as a tool. List all the tasks you need to do and give them a priority (i.e., #1, #2, #3). This strategy will help you with needs to be done "now" versus what can be done "later". Add these tasks to a timeline of your day listed in 15-30 min increments. Ensure you have room in your schedule for unplanned events/needs and frontload care.
