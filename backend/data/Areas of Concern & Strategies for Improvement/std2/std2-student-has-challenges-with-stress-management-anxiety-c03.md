# STANDARD 2: Knowledge-Based Practice

## Concern
Student has challenges with stress management/anxiety

## Strategies & Guidance
- Use systems and tools that support you: Cheat sheet with a developed timeline in 15-30 min increments; highlight planned focused assessments; write lab value ranges & develop a systematic way of approaching every patient (i.e., A, B, C, D (diagnoses - why is the patient here?), E (equipment - check all tubes lines and drains), S (safety). Practice this same system in clinical and lab. Practice assessments and skills in Open Lab to build confidence. Advocate for yourself- request a few minutes to compose your thoughts or organize your information if you are asked a question and feel flustered. Avoid rushing to respond with scattered information or missing data.
