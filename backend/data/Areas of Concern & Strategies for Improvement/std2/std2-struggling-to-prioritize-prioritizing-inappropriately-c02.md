# STANDARD 2: Knowledge-Based Practice

## Concern
Struggling to prioritize/prioritizing inappropriately

## Strategies & Guidance
- Look at the physician's orders and the Kardex/nursing plan for clues as to what the priority problems are and what might be potential problems e.g. if an opioid was given, a potential problem would be side effects from the opioid (resp depression, nausea, constipation, etc. Connect your meds, lab values, tubes/lines/drains and diagnostic tests to your problems (in your care plan).
- The plan of care should be organized and focused on the priority problem. For instance, your assessments should validate (or invalidate) a problem and interventions should "fix/address" the problem. Although priority problems may be inter-linked, you should have a focus when researching and preparing for your plan of care. After every assessment pause and consider "what does this information tell me"? "are the problems validated"? Make the adjustment, then make sense of it. Identify the validating S&S and then consider patho, lab, med links etc. If there is a change in status from what you are anticipating, assess and communicate prior to intervening.
