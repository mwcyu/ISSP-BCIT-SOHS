# STANDARD 2: Knowledge-Based Practice

## Concern
Student endangered patient's safety

## Strategies & Guidance
- In your cheat sheet, identify the interventions that you would need to have "signed off" or that you would need additional monitoring and assessment for. Report your planned intervention to your nurse and instructor. There is a policy or protocol for almost everything in acute care settings. Get in the habit of linking a "safety plan" to your planned intervention.
- Use additional supports to practice your organization and nursing process (e.g. attend Open Lab, work with peers, seek peer tutoring)
- Prior to going into a patient's room - pause - collect your thoughts - and imagine being in the room. What are you going to do first? When you are sensing some uncertainty about your next action - Pause and think - then consider "do I need to clarify something or do I need to act". Ask if you are uncertain.
- Make your ABCS systematic but stay aware of what is happening with your patient so that you notice anything changing etc.
