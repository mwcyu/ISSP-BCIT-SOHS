# STANDARD 2: Knowledge-Based Practice

## Concern
Student failed to focus on patient's needs

## Strategies & Guidance
- Look at the physician's orders and the Kardex/nursing care plan for clues as to what the priority problems are and what might be potential problems E.g. if an antiemetic is ordered, nausea would be an actual or potential problem, if a narcotic is ordered, pain would be an actual or potential problem and if an opioid was given, a potential problem would be side effects from the opioid (resp depression, nausea, constipation, etc.).
