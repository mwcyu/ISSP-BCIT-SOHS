# STANDARD 2: Knowledge-Based Practice

## Concern
Looking at the complete picture- (big picture, small picture, individualized picture)

## Strategies & Guidance
- Think through connections & anticipate problems: Think about how the patient's medications, fluids, focused assessments, complications/S&S, therapies/treatments relate to medical diagnoses, related tests/Labs (High, Low, WNL), applicable nursing diagnoses, patient teaching/nursing interventions. In other words, how does what we do relate to what is going on with the patient - if something does not make sense then it needs to be questioned. If you don't have time prior to clinical do this during or after so you see where the connections are. This can assist you when you experience similar patients through seeing similarities and differences.
- When something is abnormal e.g.: high output of JP, take a moment to look at the whole picture of the patient - VS, LOC etc. Then determine your clinical decision and confidently discuss with all your data. Don't just stop at the abnormal and question it - gather info first (be a detective).
- Research the most common diagnoses and/or surgeries on your unit so you are familiar with A&P and common assessments/interventions. Review PPOS
