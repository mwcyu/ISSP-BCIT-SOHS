# STANDARD 2: Knowledge-Based Practice

## Concern
Student is unable to manage timeframes

## Strategies & Guidance
- Set a quiet timer before entering the room so you are aware if you get sidetracked/go over time. Recognize when you are being distracted/interrupted/sidetracked and get back on track asap (be appropriately assertive) - if you can't identify this, ask a peer or your instructor to observe you. Look at your timeline before deciding what to do next - a good place to do this is often after hand hygiene outside the patient's room. Write things down before moving on to your next task and write down times of occurrence and a brief note of anything you need to document. Document as soon as possible after completing priorities.
