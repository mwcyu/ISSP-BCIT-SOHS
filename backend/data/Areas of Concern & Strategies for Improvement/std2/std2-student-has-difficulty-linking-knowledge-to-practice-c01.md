# STANDARD 2: Knowledge-Based Practice

## Concern
Student has difficulty linking knowledge to practice

## Strategies & Guidance
Strategies:
- Connect noticing with interpretation: After every assessment pause and consider "what does this information tell me"? "are the problems validated"? Make the adjustment, then make sense of it. Be curious like a detective. Identify the validating S&S and then consider patho, lab, medication links etc. Prior to leaving the bedside, pause and look back at the patient and environment and ask yourself "have I really 'seen' this patient".
- Review your notes/resources from Nursing Knowledge classes.
- Utilize tools from the Learning Skills & Strategies and Learning Strategist and Study Skills/LibGuides
- Utilize resources on campus to practice making connections such as peer tutoring or a study buddy who is strong in clinical reasoning and planning
- After assessing a patient - pause and think. Ask yourself "have my priority problems changed? Have my priority problems been validated"? Take note of your assessment data and pause, think, assess (what more do you need to know or do before acting?).
- Try to memorize common lab values (i.e. K+, Hgb, WBC and more).
