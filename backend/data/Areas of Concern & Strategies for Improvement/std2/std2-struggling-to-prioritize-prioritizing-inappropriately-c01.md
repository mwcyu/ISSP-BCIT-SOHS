# STANDARD 2: Knowledge-Based Practice

## Concern
Struggling to prioritize/prioritizing inappropriately

## Strategies & Guidance
Strategies:
- Ranking patients: first level - ABC issues/potential issues, second level - new concerns, changes in status, increased requirements, untreated problems that need immediate attention, safety risks, third level - stable patients that have no new issues or ABC concerns, patients who will be discharged soon. On your cheat sheet put your 3 priority problems for your patient(s). Refer to this often and adjust if status changes. Prior to caring for your patient(s), you should be clear about your priorities and focused assessment linked to the priorities.
- When identifying priorities, first identify the most "obvious" links (patient diagnosis, planned focused assessment) to match with the patient. You should be able to explain the rationale for your plan. Be concise and clear. Don't create "far stretched" links. Not everything that you research about your patient can be a priority. Make decisions about your most prioritized problem based on ABCCS and the most likely problems related to the surgery/procedure/diagnosis and data supported by orders/meds.
