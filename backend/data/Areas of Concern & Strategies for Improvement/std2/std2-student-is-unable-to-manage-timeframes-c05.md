# STANDARD 2: Knowledge-Based Practice

## Concern
Student is unable to manage timeframes

## Strategies & Guidance
- Avoid rushing when you feel anxiety rising - take the moment to step back and Stop, Breathe, and Organize - review what you need to do next. If something unexpected happens - address any urgent/immediate concerns, then take a few minutes to determine what your top priorities are. Ask for guidance when appropriate as well as reporting/following up with your instructor and RN - make sure you are prepared with what you need to say/ask before you approach someone. Limit going back and forth between patients or charts without fully completing tasks or gathering all information
