# STANDARD 2: Knowledge-Based Practice

## Concern
Student is unable to manage timeframes

## Strategies & Guidance
Strategies:
- Keep a 1 page (front & back) working document/cheat sheet on you that includes a detailed timeline with checkboxes for your whole day (all patients on the same timeline & include: medications, assessments, when to check labs, I&O's, dressing changes/procedures/skills - time set up with instructor if supervision is needed, patient education, discharges, patients going for tests/surgery, documentation, re-evaluation of interventions, etc.) written in 15-30 min increments. Ensure you have room in your schedule for unplanned events/needs. On this timeline, incorporate times to seek your instructor and RN to give report and to look at charts again in more depth to make connections. Be realistic when estimating how long something will take - ask your peers/RNs/instructor for guidance.
