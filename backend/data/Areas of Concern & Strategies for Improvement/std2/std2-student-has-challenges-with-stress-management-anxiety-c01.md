# STANDARD 2: Knowledge-Based Practice

## Concern
Student has challenges with stress management/anxiety

## Strategies & Guidance
Strategies:
- Recognize and acknowledge your emotions. Consider external and BCIT supports - Student Health, Wellbeing, Stress, & Anxiety Management, Counselling & Student Development, Mindfulness for managing anxiety or "flooding" of emotion that may impact clinical reasoning and judgment. If you are already accessing these resources, utilize the strategies that you already have experience with or implement new strategies.
- Take a moment to step back to Stop what you are doing, take a deep Breath, and then Organize your thoughts/plan. Every time you go to see your patient, first, pause outside their room. Imagine yourself going in. What are you going to do first? What are you anticipating? It is okay to stop, take a deep breath and give yourself a moment to think. When you feel anxiety creeping in, this is your cue to stop and think (ask yourself "do I need more information? What is the safest decision right now"). "Pause, Think, Act" any time you are feeling flustered.
