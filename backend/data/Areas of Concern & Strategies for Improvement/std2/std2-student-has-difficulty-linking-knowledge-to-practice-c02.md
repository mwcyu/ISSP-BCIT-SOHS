# STANDARD 2: Knowledge-Based Practice

## Concern
Student has difficulty linking knowledge to practice

## Strategies & Guidance
- Consider what the most likely priority problem is based on current patient data (diagnosis, procedures, labs, meds etc.). Connect your meds, lab values, tubes/lines/drains and diagnostic tests to your problems (in your care plan and your assessment and intervention plan). Take a few minutes to make links before giving report. Re-prioritize your patient problems prior to report. If needed - ask your nurse or instructor for a few minutes to think before talking (give them exactly how much time you need).
