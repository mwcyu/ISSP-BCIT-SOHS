# STANDARD 2: Knowledge-Based Practice

## Concern
Student has specific knowledge gaps (A&P, pharmacology etc.)

## Strategies & Guidance
Strategies:
- Review your notes/resources from Nursing Knowledge classes.
- Utilize tools from the Learning Skills & Strategies and Learning Strategist and Study Skills/LibGuides
- Utilize resources on campus to practice making connections such as peer tutoring or a study buddy who is strong in clinical reasoning and planning
- Utilize BCIT and Health Authority resources. Additionally, look at patient information booklets and read through things in layman's terms as well as medical texts etc.
- Become familiar with the most common physical or mental illnesses or surgeries/procedures on your unit and familiarize yourself with policies and PPO. Collect your care plans and refer back to them for similar types of patients (like a repository).
- Go through clinical reasoning case studies similar to the patients on your assigned unit.
- At the end of every assessment pause and consider "what does this information tell me"? Consider how the information validates or invalidates an anticipated patient problem. Make the adjustment, then make sense of it. Be curious like a detective. Consider the pathophysiology, labs, medications, diagnostics, etc. and how they all link together.
