# STANDARD 2: Knowledge-Based Practice

## Concern
Looking at the complete picture- (big picture, small picture, individualized picture)

## Strategies & Guidance
Strategies:
- Look at the physician's orders for clues as to what the priority problems are and what might be potential problems e.g. if an antiemetic is ordered, nausea would be an actual or potential problem, if a narcotic is ordered, pain would be an actual or potential problem and if an opioid was given, a potential problem would be side effects from the opioid (resp depression, nausea, constipation, etc.)
- Create detailed concept maps/CJMs - if you don't have enough time prior to clinical, do this during or after so you see where the connections are. This can assist you when you experience similar patients - can help you see similarities and differences. Make time to reflect and actively make connections.
