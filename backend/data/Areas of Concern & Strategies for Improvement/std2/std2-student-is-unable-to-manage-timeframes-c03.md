# STANDARD 2: Knowledge-Based Practice

## Concern
Student is unable to manage timeframes

## Strategies & Guidance
- Prioritize what is most important throughout the day and what you can delegate if you need to. Take breaks early rather than later (don't keep trying to finish everything, delegate if necessary). Frontload and group all tasks - Start to do things 30min prior to them being due. 1000 meds at 0930, etc. Aim to get most of your "tasks" done before lunch/early in the shift so that you are prepared for the unexpected. Keep all your areas and your patient's room organized, tidy up as you are talking to them. Consider what the patient may be capable of doing and encourage independence. Set boundaries with any patients who are dominating your time with requests.
