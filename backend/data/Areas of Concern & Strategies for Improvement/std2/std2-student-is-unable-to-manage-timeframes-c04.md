# STANDARD 2: Knowledge-Based Practice

## Concern
Student is unable to manage timeframes

## Strategies & Guidance
- Build on your systems and strategies that are already working well. When you practice, assess, report, or document, follow the same system so that it becomes muscle memory. Develop a systematic way of your initial approach for every patient, however, be aware of anything that may need immediate attention. Consider using the system of ABCDE to ensure that your focused assessment is a priority (Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Diagnosis: all assessments related to the patient's current diagnosis/surgery, Equipment: check all tubes, lines, drains and other equipment, including safety equipment). If a patient status changes this a cue to start the system again. Practice this system in lab and at home until it becomes second nature.
