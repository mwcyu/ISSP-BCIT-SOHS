# STANDARD 2: Knowledge-Based Practice

## Concern
Student endangered patient's safety

## Strategies & Guidance
Immediately halt unsupervised patient care until student has demonstrated safe practice consistently while supervised. Review BCCNM Regulatory Supervision of Students.
- Have student fill out hospital authority incident report if required and BSN Safety Event form
- Refer to BCIT BSN Program Student Guidelines and Procedures
Strategies:
- Suggest student review the British Columbia College of Nurses & Midwives (BCCNM) Professional Standards
- Suggest student review the BCCNM Knowledge-Based Practice Module
- 1:1 meeting with student, preceptor and instructor discuss the situation - Program Head may be present
- Avoid rushing to action or speaking with scattered information or missing data. Allow yourself to have the moment to consider the necessary focus. Take a moment to step back to Stop what you are doing, take a deep Breath, and then Organize your thoughts/plan. Confirm that your plan is safe and makes sense to the problem as you focus on "priority problems".
- Use a Clinical Judgment Model - follow through on each step of the CJM-e.g. Noticing, Interpreting, Responding, Reflecting
