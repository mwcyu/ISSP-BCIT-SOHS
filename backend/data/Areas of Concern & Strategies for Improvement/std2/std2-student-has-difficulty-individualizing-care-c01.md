# STANDARD 2: Knowledge-Based Practice

## Concern
Student has difficulty individualizing care

## Strategies & Guidance
Strategies:
- Gather all necessary data prior to your shift - prioritize what you need to know vs nice to know. List all tubes, lines, drains, monitoring required and look up the unfamiliar. Ensure you discuss what you are unsure about with instructor/RN first thing in the morning. Make sure you understand why patient has a tube/line and drain - the purpose of it and what/why you are monitoring. Connect your meds, lab values, tubes/lines/drains and diagnostic tests to your problems. Make sure you understand why each medication is given - specifically for your patient. Determine what nursing interventions/considerations need to be made with the medication.
- Talk to your RN/instructor about your clinical decisions - explain your reasoning/rationale and support this with evidence.
- Put your Actual and Potential Problems for your patient on your concept map/CJM/cheat sheet with assessments and interventions this will help guide your care. Prior to caring for your patient, think of what patient education you may need to know. Have your goals for your patient on the concept map/CJM/cheat sheet and understand reasoning/education behind these goals.
