# STANDARD 2: Knowledge-Based Practice

## Concern
Student has challenges with stress management/anxiety

## Strategies & Guidance
- Practice being distracted while also needing to complete a task (have a conversation while washing the dishes or fixing something). Find a peer who can be your "reporting person". Practice giving report on case studies, or on previous patients using ISBAR. Ask for feedback.
- At the end of every assessment pause and consider "what does this information tell me"? Consider how the information validates or invalidates an anticipated patient problem. Make the adjustment, then make sense of it. Be curious like a detective. Consider the patho links, lab links, med links etc. Commit some common things to memory (common lab ranges E.g. Hgb, K, WBC, vital sign ranges).
- Practice "thinking" under pressure (e.g. time yourself in a case study, have an observer during open lab). Advocate for yourself if you need more time to think. However, be sure to give a timeline to your RN/instructor for how long you need and then initiate the follow up.
