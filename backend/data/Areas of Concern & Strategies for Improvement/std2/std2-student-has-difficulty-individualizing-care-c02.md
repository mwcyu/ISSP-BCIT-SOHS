# STANDARD 2: Knowledge-Based Practice

## Concern
Student has difficulty individualizing care

## Strategies & Guidance
- Look at your patient's history and write out a timeline of what happened first, next, etc. leading up to the present moment. What is their current plan of care? Are they progressing to wellness? Are they declining? Are they under palliative care? Are they close to discharge? Are multiple issues occurring? Do they have a firm diagnosis?
