# STANDARD 3: Patient-Focused Provision of Service

## Concern
Student displays inappropriate or ineffective communication skills (THIS COULD BE STANDARD 1 as well)

## Strategies & Guidance
Strategies:
- Advocate for yourself to have some time to collect your thoughts prior to reporting to your instructor. Try to initiate the report rather than waiting for your instructor to find you. Request a few minutes to compose your thoughts or organize your information if you are asked a question and feel flustered.
- Be specific and clear in your terminology. Avoid using "low" and "high". Use specific values and nursing language. If you are unsure of something, try not to guess "out loud". Seek clarification or identify "I think it is XXX, but I need to look it up to confirm. Commit some information to memory for "quick recall" (for instance, normal Hgb, K+, WBC). Write short notes on your cheat sheet for anything you find difficult to explain.
- Advocate for yourself and clarify your instructor's expectations and the expectations of your clinical practice site. Do this pro-actively rather than waiting for instructions.
- Practice giving unscripted report on case studies. Use your cheat sheet as a 'prompt' in clinical but challenge yourself in practice to make connections without a script. Record yourself giving ISBAR report for reflection.
