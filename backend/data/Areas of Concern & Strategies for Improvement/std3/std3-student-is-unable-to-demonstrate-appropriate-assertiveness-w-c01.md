# STANDARD 3: Patient-Focused Provision of Service

## Concern
Student is unable to demonstrate appropriate assertiveness when advocating for patients

## Strategies & Guidance
Strategies:
- Review the BCCNM Patient-Focused Provision of Care Module
- Seek out opportunities to talk to HCPs and physicians, do not wait for the opportunities to come to you. Challenge yourself to get to know at least 1 HCP per set of shifts. Find out their name and talk to them about your patient.
- You are part of the health care team and have vital information that you can share. In addition, information they have may impact how you care for your patients.
- Take lead in reporting to your instructor. Approach your instructor with your patient's problems - inform them of your assessments, interventions, and what you will re-evaluate. Explain your clinical decision-making process for determining this. Do not wait for them to ask you questions. Work toward independent practice. Write notes or follow a format when talking to your instructor.
