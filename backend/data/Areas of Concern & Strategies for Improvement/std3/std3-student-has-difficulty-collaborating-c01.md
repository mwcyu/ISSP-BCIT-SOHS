# STANDARD 3: Patient-Focused Provision of Service

## Concern
Student has difficulty collaborating

## Strategies & Guidance
Strategies:
- Build a partnership with your instructor, peers, and other members of the team: Identify shared goals in learning and seek clarity on expectations (each term, site, and instructor may have a new way of implementing the principles of content).
- Advocate for yourself and seek clarity about any identified challenges. Ask for 1:1 time with your instructor to review a clinical day and discuss/articulate your plan/research.
- Take the initiative to set time to seek out your instructor and report (use ISBAR or report on your plan/actions and your decision-making process).
