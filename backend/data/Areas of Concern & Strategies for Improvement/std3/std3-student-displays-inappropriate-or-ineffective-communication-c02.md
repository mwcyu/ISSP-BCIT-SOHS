# STANDARD 3: Patient-Focused Provision of Service

## Concern
Student displays inappropriate or ineffective communication skills (THIS COULD BE STANDARD 1 as well)

## Strategies & Guidance
- Collaborate with peers to practice giving report. Once you have ensured that you have all the information you need, quickly write down what you need to say in an ISBAR format so you can refer to it while giving report - ensure you are telling a logical story - start at the beginning, explain the middle, and finish at the end/conclusion.
- Anticipate that the patient will ask you questions - you may be able to anticipate the kinds of questions patients will ask based on their chart data (Eg. if they smoke, etc.). Practice being interrupted during a skill or assessment (at home or in lab - ask someone to interrupt you). Review relational practice techniques until they become comfortable.
